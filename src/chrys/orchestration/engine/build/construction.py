    """What a rebuild reads *instead of* live engine state, committed whole.

    A rebuild used to stage its inputs by assigning them to the engine before
    the build and assigning them back on failure. Every await inside the build
    made that a lie: any concurrent task reading the engine saw an uncommitted,
    possibly-about-to-roll-back value. The staged inputs travel here as
    parameters instead, the build reads only these, and
    :func:`build_agent` installs all of them in the same breath as the
    executor they configured — so live state either describes the old build
    entirely or the new one entirely, never a mixture.

    ``loaded`` carries settings and provenance as the one value they already
    are; the agent profile, the workspace, the hook manager and the
    mutation-coordinator target are the other four things a rebuild may
    change. Six commitments, one commit point.
